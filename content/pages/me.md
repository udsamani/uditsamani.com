My name is Udit. I am student at **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. Currently I am in my senior year and happily looking for a job. My main interests include **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Deep Learning**. In addition, I love writing articles related to Machine Learning.

A few highlights:
- [Naive Bayes Algorithm](/naive-bayes/), describing its application with adequate description of theory.
- Explaining [Hypothesis Testing](/hypothesis-testing/) for Data Analysis.

I started this website as a place to document everything related Artificial Intelligence. Being a student I have faced so many challenges while learning AI concepts. The articles writted by variety of people on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/) have been really helpful to me. But now it is my turn to give back to this AI community. **KUDOS!**

### Some things I like

Making websites, singing, **skiing**, and playing baskteball. I am a **DIE HARD** Golden State Warriors fan.
