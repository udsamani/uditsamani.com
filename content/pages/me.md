 I'm Udit Samani, a student at **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. Currently I am in my senior year and looking for a job. My main interests include **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Deep Learning**. In addition, I love writing articles related to **Computer Science**.

I started this website as a place to document everything related to Computer Science. Being a student I have faced so many challenges while learning different concepts. The articles written by variety of people on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/) have been really helpful to me. But now it is my turn to give back. **KUDOS!**
